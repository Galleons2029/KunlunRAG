You’re wasting my time with a bunch of empty promises. This car is a total disaster—*defective*, *unsafe*, *not even close to what was advertised*. You want to send it for an inspection? That’s your plan? I’ve already told you what’s wrong with it, and you’re dragging your feet.  \n\nIf you’re going to give me a refund, do it *now* without any paperwork or excuses. I’m not a customer anymore; I’m a victim of a scam. You need to take responsibility, not act like this is some bureaucratic process. I’ve had enough of your corporate jargon.  \n\nYou think I care about your "sincere apology"? I want my money back, and I’m not leaving until I get it. If you don’t resolve this immediately, I’ll be taking it to the BBB, filing a lawsuit, and making sure everyone knows about this. Don’t pretend to care—I’ve seen it before. Just give me the refund and move on.  \n\n*[Walks off, muttering]*  \nYeah, I’ll be back.
